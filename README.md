## Economic trend analysis script written in Python that calculates average annual growth rates per category and identifies expansion or contraction trends over time.

This Python script analyzes Canadian household final consumption expenditure data sourced by Statistics Canada. It reads the CSV dataset, which tracks quarterly spending across categories such as Food & Non-Alcoholic Beverages, Housing & Utilities, Transport, and Recreation & Culture, and computes year-over-year growth rates and derives the average annual growth rate for each category. Results are stated in plain English, clearly indicating whether each spending category is on an expansionary or contractionary trend, making it easy to identify shifts in Canadian consumer spending patterns without any manual calculation.

## Research Paper

The script is supported by an accompanying research paper, *Impact of Inflation on Canadian Household Consumption (2019–2025)*, which provides the economic context and interpretation behind the data. While the script identifies the trends, the paper explains what they mean. It examines how inflation unequally affected Canadian household spending between 2019 and 2025, finding that essential categories such as housing and food remained resilient, while discretionary categories such as transport and recreation were far more volatile. The paper concludes that inflation reshaped Canadian spending priorities rather than permanently suppressing overall demand, with total household consumption recovering and surpassing pre-pandemic levels by 2023–2025.
